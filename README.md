# Goals
My goal is to implement the algorithms listed in the paper in order to
understand them better. I think the data structures are going to be the hardest
part.

Well, this didn't happen. I ended up just messing around with Z3 for the rest
of the time and trying to understand their examples.

## To-Implement
* [ ] Data Structures for I and N
* [ ] WPreFromPre (Figure 5)
* [ ] WPre (Figure 6)
* [ ] SPost (Figure 8)
